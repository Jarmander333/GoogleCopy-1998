# GoogleCopy-1998

My copy of a fully functional version of Google from 1998, but it's modern.  

## Setup

By default, the search bar does not function well... There is commented out code that has the Google Programmable Search Bar in it, if you comment that out, the search bar will be fully functional, but the page may look weird.  

## Programs

I used the following programs to complete this project:

 - Notepad++

### DO NOT HOST THIS ON YOUR OWN SERVER, AND/OR CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN.  I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS - ASK ME AND THEN I WILL DECIDE.  THIS IS MY CODE, IT IS FOR VIEWING\HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY...
